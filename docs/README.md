## Using These Documents in Your RAG System

### Document Organization

Each document is structured with:
- Clear hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Code examples with language tags
- Practical examples and anti-patterns
- Comprehensive tables of contents
- Cross-references where applicable

### Recommended Chunking Strategy

For optimal RAG performance:

1. **By Section:** Chunk by H2 or H3 headings (recommended)
2. **By Example:** Group code examples with their explanations
3. **By Pattern:** Keep "Good vs Bad" examples together
4. **Chunk Size:** 500-1000 tokens per chunk optimal

### Metadata Recommendations

Add these metadata fields when ingesting:

```json
{
  "document_title": "PRD_Best_Practices.md",
  "section": "PRD Templates",
  "subsection": "Shapeup Pitch",
  "document_type": "best_practices",
  "category": "product_management",
  "keywords": ["prd", "template", "basecamp", "agile"],
  "last_updated": "2025-10-21"
}
```

### Search Optimization

**Recommended indexing for each document:**

**PRD_Best_Practices.md:**
- Keywords: PRD, product requirements, templates, product management
- Semantic: product documentation, specifications, feature planning

**Supabase_Backend_Best_Practices.md:**
- Keywords: RLS, row level security, performance, database, PostgreSQL
- Semantic: backend optimization, database security, query performance

**Frontend_Best_Practices.md:**
- Keywords: React, Next.js, authentication, real-time, TypeScript
- Semantic: frontend development, UI integration, client libraries

**Prompt_Engineering_Best_Practices.md:**
- Keywords: LLM, prompts, GPT, AI, temperature, few-shot
- Semantic: AI integration, language models, prompt optimization

**Supabase_Security_Best_Practices.md:**
- Keywords: security, compliance, HIPAA, SOC2, encryption, audit

## Integration Tips

### Supabase Integration

```sql
-- Create documents table
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    content text NOT NULL,
    embedding vector(1536), -- For OpenAI embeddings
    metadata jsonb,
    created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create index for similarity search
CREATE INDEX ON documents 
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Insert document chunks
INSERT INTO documents (title, content, metadata, embedding)
VALUES (
    'PRD Best Practices - Section 1',
    'Document content here...',
    '{"source": "PRD_Best_Practices.md", "section": "Introduction"}'::jsonb,
    embedding_vector
);
```

### Query Examples

```typescript
// Semantic search
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('match_documents', {
    query_embedding: embedding,
    match_threshold: 0.78,
    match_count: 5
});

// Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
const { data } = await supabase
    .from('documents')
    .select('*')
    .textSearch('content', 'RLS performance optimization')
    .limit(10);
```
