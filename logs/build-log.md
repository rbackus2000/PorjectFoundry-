## 2025-10-20 20:40 - T5a/T5b/T5e: Core UI Components
- Created app shell with header, sidebar, and content area layout
- Implemented design system tokens in `globals.css` (bg, surface, text, subtext, border, primary)
- Built shadcn/ui components: Button, Card, Input, Label, Badge, Tabs, KpiTile
- Created all page routes: `/dashboard`, `/canvas`, `/prd`, `/artifacts`, `/settings`
- Dashboard includes 4 KPI tiles and quick actions section
- Artifacts page includes tabs for Flows, ERD, Prompt Packs, UI Spec
- All pages have proper placeholder content and styled layouts

## 2025-10-20 20:45 - T2: Prisma Database Setup Complete
- Created `prisma/schema.prisma` with models: Project, ProjectGraph, Artifact, Event, DecisionLog
- Set up Prisma client in `lib/db/prisma.ts`
- Fixed SQLite compatibility (Json → String for graphData and payload fields)
- Generated Prisma client successfully
- Ran initial migration `20251021014400_init`
- Database created at `dev.db` and schema is in sync
- Added unique constraint on `[projectId, type]` for Artifact upserts

## 2025-10-20 20:50 - T3: Zod Schemas Defined
- Created comprehensive `lib/zodSchemas.ts` with all core types
- Defined: Idea, PRD, BackendSpec, FrontendSpec, UISpec, ResearchReport, ProjectGraph
- Defined: ModuleNode, ModuleEdge, SystemEvent variants
- All schemas strictly typed with zod validation
- 300+ lines of schema definitions covering entire domain

## 2025-10-20 20:55 - T4: Event Bus & Reconciliation Engine
- Created `lib/events/bus.ts` - event publishing and subscription system
- Created `lib/events/reconcile.ts` - DAG-based regeneration orchestrator
- Created `lib/events/invariants.ts` - cross-artifact consistency checks
- Event bus persists to DB and triggers handlers
- Reconcile engine follows dependency order: Research → PRD → BE → FE → UI → Mermaid → Packs
- Invariants check: FE APIs match BE, ERD matches PRD, UI components exist in FE

## 2025-10-20 21:00 - T7: Agent Stubs Implemented
- Created 6 agent modules returning structured JSON:
  - `orchestrator.ts` - coordinates full generation pipeline
  - `pmAgent.ts` - generates PRD from idea, graph, research
  - `beAgent.ts` - generates backend spec with entities, APIs, jobs
  - `feAgent.ts` - generates frontend spec with routes, components, state
  - `uiAgent.ts` - generates UI spec with design system, components, screens
  - `researchAgent.ts` - generates research reports with citations (stub interfaces for crawler, embeddings)
- All agents return mock data conforming to zod schemas
- Ready for LLM integration (placeholders marked with TODO)

## 2025-10-20 21:05 - T8/T9: Mermaid & Prompt Pack Generators
- Created `lib/mermaid/makeFlowchart.ts` - generates Mermaid flowcharts from project graph
- Created `lib/mermaid/makeErDiagram.ts` - generates ERD from backend spec
- Created prompt pack builders for 4 platforms:
  - `buildCursorPack.ts` - comprehensive pack with ERD, APIs, user stories
  - `buildClaudePack.ts` - optimized for Claude Code workflow
  - `buildLovablePack.ts` - frontend-focused with design system
  - `buildBoltPack.ts` - full-stack rapid prototyping format
- All generators produce markdown with embedded Mermaid diagrams
- Packs include PRD sections, tech stack, implementation notes

## 2025-10-20 21:15 - T10/T12: Figma Plugin & Documentation Complete
- Created Figma plugin scaffold with manifest.json, code.ts, ui.html
- Plugin reads ui-spec.json and generates design system + screen frames
- Compiled comprehensive README.md with architecture, quick start, deployment guides
- Created `/api/generate` endpoint that runs full generation pipeline
- Updated TASKS.md to reflect completion status
- All core systems operational and ready for extension

## 2025-10-20 21:20 - BUILD COMPLETE ✅

### Summary of Deliverables
**Core Infrastructure:**
